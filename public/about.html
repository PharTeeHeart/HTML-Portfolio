<p>I am Ojobaro Taiwo Fathia by name this might looks funny but i prefer being called Fathia probably cuz all i dont want to be seen as a twin i am, lol sounds funny right. Don't get me wrong i don't hate being a twin, i just don't enjoy having to explain why my sister and I are not always together.
   i love my sister and that's all that matters. she must not see this though. 
   We are not always 100% together like we attended different schools and all, 
   we definitely do not want that but circumstances warrant that, and we can't change destiny.
   What is destined to happen will. Also i love the name Fathia soooo much .
   That's my favourite of all my names, so call me FATHIA. </p>

<p>The next paragraph is gonna be about what i love. what do you think i love........ I LOVE FOOD.
  My people taunt me sooo much about it cuz why would i love food look at my stature it doesn't look like i eat at all.
  But honestly i'm not minding anyone cuz who does not eat, we need food to survive.
  I'm eating to survive thats what i tell myself lol.
</p>

<p>I think i've written enough rubbish already let me move to the next thing on this exercise
