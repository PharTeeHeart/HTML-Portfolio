<p>I am Ojobaro Taiwo Fathia by name this might looks funny but i prefer being called Fathia probably cuz all i dont want to be seen as a twin i am, lol sounds funny right. Don't get me wrong i don't hate being a twin, i just don't enjoy people assuming my lovely sister is late. i love my sister more than that; she must not see this though. We are not always 100% together like we attended different schools and all, we definitely do not want that but we circumstances warrant that, and we can't change destiny. what is destined to happen will. Imagine people meeting me in school and i'm like i am Taiwo then the next thing is where is your sister before given chance to explain they make assumptions already cuz they belive we have to be together at all times because we are twins. Also i love my muslim name soooo much that i want to be called by it anytime.That's my favourite of all my names, so call me FATHIA. </p>

<p>The next paragraph is gonna be about what i love. what do you think i love........ I LOVE FOOD.
  My people taunt me sooo much about it cuz why would i love food look at my stature it doesn't look like i eat at all.
  But honestly i'm not minding anyone cuz who does not eat, we need food to survive.
  I'm eating to survive thats what i tell myself lol.
</p>

<p>I think i've written enough rubbish already let me move to the next thing bon this exercise
